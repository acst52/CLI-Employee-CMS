# CLI Employee CMS!
![license badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

In this Module 12 Challenge, we were tasked to create an employee content management system (CMS), a non-developer friendly command-line app that manages a company's employee database in the command-line interface (CLI). We used Node.js, the Inquirer package and MySQL. You can peep said walkthrough video here:

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command: 
```
npm i
```

## Usage

To use this employee CMS, in your CLI, run `npm start` and choose from the options to add a department, add a role, add an employee, view all departments, roles or employees and update an employee's role. You can come back to them and edit your company's database as you wish, because your departments, roles and employees are stored in a MySQL database :)
